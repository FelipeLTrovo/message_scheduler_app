ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome!

A simple application for scheduling messages to be sent via Whatapp Web.

As of now, the application presents the following features:

- Sign up and Sign in as an User.
- Register, show, edit and delete Users and Messages.

# Setup

After cloning the project run the following command on the project's root directory and the Backend server will get started.

```sh
bundle install && rails s
```

In order to start the Frontend server, open a new terminal tab and run the following command:
```sh
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

ðŸš€ :clap: Finally, you can access the application by heading out to: [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
